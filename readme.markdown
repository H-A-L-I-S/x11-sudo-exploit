# xkbcat [![](https://img.shields.io/travis/anko/xkbcat.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/anko/xkbcat)

Simple X11 keylogger.

 - Simple output format:  one line on `stdout` per key event.
 - Simple to audit:  <100 lines of modern C.
 - Simple to run:  Does not need `sudo`.

## Examples

### Keypresses only

Given no flags, `xkbcat` prints only keypresses, one per line. Here's the
output when I type "Hi":

    Shift_L
    h
    i

### Keypresses and key-ups

With key-ups enabled (`xkbcat -up`), the format changes to show them:

    + Shift_L
    + h
    - h
    - Shift_L
    + i
    - i

Lines starting `+` are key-downs; `-` are key-ups.

## Compilation

Just `make`.

Don't have `X11/extensions/XInput2.h`?  Install your distro's `libxi-devel`
package.

## Usage

Flags you can pass (all optional):

 - `-display <display>`: set target X display (default `:0`)
 - `-up`: also prepend key-ups (default: don't)
 - `-help`: print usage hints and exit

Then just use your computer as usual.  Interrupt signal (`C-c`) to quit.

## Related programs

### Other keyloggers

 - If you need to log keys across a whole Linux system (also in the
   framebufferâ€”not just in X11), try [keysniffer][1].  It works via a kernel
   module, and needs `sudo`.
 - If you want to see what characters the user actually typed (with modifier
   keys, backspace, etc resolved into text), [`xspy`][2] or [`logkeys`][3]
   might be better for you.

### Programs that work well together with `xkbcat`

 - If you want to add timestamps to each line for logging purposes, I recommend
   piping to the [moreutils package][4]'s `ts`.  [These answers][5] feature
   various other tools good for the purpose.

### Programs for logging other X11 events

 - [xinput][6] invoked as `xinput --test-xi2 --root` logs everything; even
   mouse movements and clicks, and touchpad stuff.  Its output is very
   comprehensive, but harder to parse.

 - If you need to log X11 events more generally, various protocol monitoring
   programs are listed in the [X11 debugging guide][7].
